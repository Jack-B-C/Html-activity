    <h2>Treaty of Waitangi</h2>
    <p>The Treaty of Waitangi (or Te Tiriti o Waitangi in Māori), is New Zealand's founding document written in 1840. <br> It is a document stating the agreement between the British Crown and the Māori to live in unity.</p>
    <h3>The Signing of the Treaty of Waitangi</h3>
    <p>The British government intended to annex New Zealand in attempt to regulate the growing number of British migrants moving to New Zealand, secure commercial interests, and protect the Māori.<br> The Māori were convinced to sign the Treaty, unaware the effects British sovereignty will have due to a translation issue between the English and Māori copies.<br> After over 500 Māori chiefs signed the treaty, British sovereignty over New Zealand was proclaimed on May 21st, 1840.</p>
